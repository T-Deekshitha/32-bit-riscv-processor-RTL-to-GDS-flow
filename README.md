# 32-bit-riscv-processor-RTL-to-GDS-flow

This project involves RTL to GDS flow of picorv32 (32 bit RISC V) processor using OpenROAD, an open source for digital ASIC design.
PicoRV32 stands out as a compact, RV32I-compliant soft-core processor optimized for resource-constrained environments. This project focuses on the ASIC design of the PicoRV32 core using OpenROAD-flow-scripts, a fully automated RTL-to-GDSII flow built around the OpenROAD toolchain. Unlike traditional commercial EDA tools, OpenROAD enables a transparent and flexible environment for digital backend design. 

Different parameters like clock, core utilization and place density were tried and analyzed slack, power and area.
